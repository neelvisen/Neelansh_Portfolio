## Bio
Welcome to my landing page! My name is Neelansh (Neel for short), and I'm currently working as a Consultant at KPMG in Toronto. As a member of the Enterprise Solutions team, my job is to leverage Microsoft's suite of applications and technologies to develop practical business solutions for clients and stakeholders.

I graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in economics, mathematics, and statistics in 2021. Outside of work, I love staying active (currently training for a marathon), cooking, following sports, watching movies, and playing games like Chess, the NYT Crossword, and Jeopardy!

Feel free to take a look around at some of my old projects, resume, or contact me at neelvisen@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/neelansh/).
