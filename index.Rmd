## Bio
Welcome to my landing page! My name is Neelansh (Neel), and I'm currently working as a Consultant at KPMG in Toronto. As part of the Enterprise Solutions (MS) team, my goal is to leverage Microsoft's extensive suite of next generation applications and technologies to deliver real-world business solutions to clients and stakeholders alike.

A lifelong numbers guy, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in economics, mathematics, and statistics in 2021. I am a firm believer in the the storytelling power of data, and hope to continue forging a career in analytics.
